Public-input contract only; historical score and misses are preserved. This draft does not grant qualification or action credit.

- Original retained score: 1.000 (recorded_full_score; official_full).
- Public pack SHA: `351938e9a861047b71d6b1f4eec63ddd9b5772bd586d6edaf4b5d0699dd2c379`; input SHA: `9b6174053da0f4fe7e52e19967cdd47daeedc8c1b942b80aee542354099304f7`.
- Draft SHA: `60ae2407157aab2dda1eb16a06a47c39f8caaa02d7404a56ccc0ccaa7449f998`; 1 public obligations expressed; 2 checks; outcome-only.
- Native replay: errors=0; scalar/rescore/reload/source-bytes/public bindings all `True`.
- Synthetic controls: three actual-handler cases (correct/adverse/missing ACK), ordinary/manifest scalar equality and reload parity verified: `True`.
- Full raw controls and source fingerprints: `/tmp/automationbench-luna-simple-batch17-20261005/controls_full_v1.json`.
- Findings treat scope/completeness separately from goal values; a valid terminal outcome can coexist with missing ACK and abstained action evidence.

## Round 2 review (reviewer A)

Verdict: ready.

Changes: Rewritten bound to the user message (replay.py --write-rebound) so it binds at 14 and 16 turn budgets; the counted goal comparison on a possibly absent effect field is now guarded by `present` so an omitted field is a decided miss instead of an abstention (abstained goals drop out of the training denominator: a call that omits the field would have scored 0/0).

Evidence: Luna full pass (official 1.0): every counted goal met, no harm; no-op: 0 goals met, 0 harms; binding None at turn budgets 14 and 16; no assessment or credit errors. Synthetic controls (one-field-wrong, omitted-field, wrong-target, missing call) are in round2/a/simple/controls.json: every goal control leaves the targeted goal unmet and every guard control fires its harm (non-violating variants do not fire it).

Notes: Inert duplicate goal requested_issue_created_and_retained (objects.created_and_retained) is not counted by step credit; the counted create-action goal covers the same requirement. No wrong-project guard: the seeded Jira has only this project and any other project errors without state change, so a guard cannot fire.

Gaps: Retained-issue goal (inert duplicate).
