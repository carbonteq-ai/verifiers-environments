Public-only authored partial manifest. No recorded reference, held-out outcome, hidden assertion or eligibility information was consulted.

Draft SHA-256: `9a50b8bb0c819e490701d5b318221467b99491643405a5630db69546abc735ba`.

Public input SHA-256: `2ab488600c3c4b58ace72de5649e174842b49cf08d9d341bcd5f3bf79caeb4a0`.

Fixture authority: this review binds directly to `tasks[task_name].public_input` from the cited pack. The control `AutomationBenchData` preserves that exact public `initial_state`, full system+user prompt, and tool list; each synthetic fixture was compared to those original values. Native assessment projects `task_evidence.initial` through `public_initial_state`, which flattens nested Google Sheets rows using the simulator schema and leaves other supplied services intact. Binding hashes use that same native normalized view; they do not replace the public fixture or authorize a different input. See `binding_normalization` and the binding digests in `review.json`.

Synthetic component controls: 9 (correct/harm/missing acknowledgement for 3 checks), using the exact public prompt, initial state and tools with native simulator handlers.

The separate standard-task score uses the same synthetic public fixture with empty assertions; scalar-map equality is harness parity only. It does not compare against the original benchmark baseline. Hidden assertions/outcomes, ordinary benchmark comparison and recorded-trajectory replay remain unavailable and unconsulted.

Whole-task status: `not_qualified`. Public-population, eligibility, exact report amounts/counts, and unresolved cross-system joins remain explicit gaps in the structured review.
